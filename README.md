## Ideas for student projects

### Easy

- Change the dimensions of the game window.
- Name your game.
- Find your own custom artwork.
- Find your own fonts.
- Find your own sound effects and music.
- Change point value for coins.
- Make power-ups give points to player.
- Make health display hearts/max.

### Medium

- Create your own custom artwork.
- Give points for completing a level
- Create invincibility (star) power-up
- Create a power-up which increases the max hearts a player can have.
- Track coins separately from the score. (They can still be worth points.) Give an extra live when a number of coins is earned. Reset the coins after a life is given.
- Invent your own custom power-up.
- Invent a "power-up" which has a negative consequence on a player other than reducing hearts or lives.
- Display lives with a character icon x number of lives.
- Make a player die when they fall through the bottom of the world.
- Make a cool credits layer for when the player wins the game.
- Add a 'Pause' stage to the game which is activated when the player presses 'P' (or a button on the joystick). All movement and time should stop during a pause stage. Pressing 'P' again should resume. Be sure to show a message indicating the game is paused.
- Create a custom splash screen.

### Hard

- Design a standard level.
- Design a space level, underwater level, etc.
- Customize the background layer for a level.
- Customize the scenery layer for a level.
- Customize the foreground layer for a level.
- Animate your custom sprites.
- Change the game so that it uses the XBox controller instead of the keyboard.

### How clever are you?

- Add a moving element such as clouds to the background or scenery layer.
- Create Bullet enemy. Spawn them randomly in the active layer when it starts. Have them respawn to the right of the active layer when they leave the world.
- Create some other kind of custom enemy with unique behavior.
- Display actual hearts to show health. Show empty hearts when health not full.
- Show time on the stats layer. Give a time bonus for completing a level. Have the hero die if the level is not completed in a set amount of time.
- Add secret parts of the level that utilize vertical scrolling.
- Add ladders to the game. If a player is on a ladder, don't apply gravity. Assign vy by player input instead.
- Put warp pipes or doors in a game. 
- Put switches in the game that open areas of a level.
- Put mystery blocks in the game.

### More!

- Create a text/image advertisement for your game.
- Create a video advertisement for your game.
- Write a review of a classmate's game.
- Create a website for your game.


## Grading 

Each small phase of the game we've built in class will count as a minor assessment. (You'll get a 100% for each unless I suspect that you're not keeping up. In that case, I'll check up on you indvidually.)

One major assessment will be to create a single level of a game with custom artwork, complex level design, and a couple selected easy/medium features. 

The second major assessment will be customizing the game by adding a variety of easy, medium, hard features, each of which has different point values.
